	Prole Zero is still in disbelief that such a thing is possible. One's opinion, broadcast to the ENTIRE WORLD...for free! Oh Venerable Guttenberg - would that you were alive today to see what your invention has wrought. From printing press to Wordpress. From movable type to MovableType(tm). Amazing.

	I cannot believe that the hegemon has allowed such a thing to come to pass. Surely it cannot last - this ultimate weapon in the hands of the proletariat. The hegemon will surely try to subvert it - perhaps fill the space with cheap sex, pop stars and sports scores. Perhaps he may even use this incredible medium to show us TV shows (after all, he does use the television to show us TV shows). When all this fails he will surely try and pull the plug. But it will already be too late. The proletarian has finally broken the stranglehold of the hegemon on information. His support for free and open source software will have saved the proletarian. You do use open source software, right?

      Now that the prole has his website, he's going to make good use of it to redress the imbalance he sees every day. All over the world, all over the media, the newspapers, television channels and even the internet, there is a quite inexplicable lack of a point of view that makes sense to the prole. Pretty and rich people are everywhere, but alas, they have little to do with me. Constantly, one is being exhorted to aspire to a lifestyle that quite frankly makes little sense. Vacuuous people, shiny things - don't they understand that the prole is not interested?
    </p>
    <p>What the prole really needs is some peace. Some respite from his work, some decent leisure, a society that cares for itself and its citizens, peace on earth and fraternal love between all - simple things. Basic things. The oysters and the Omegas are frankly, not a priority at the moment. But prole - you can't have those aforementioned things unless society as a whole strives for the Omegas and the high class call girls. You see, without rich people, it is not possible to progress. Hmmm....there's that idea again. Do keep coming back for a systematic demolition of this patently absurd idea. (sigh...not again...)

    <p>Do read the <a href="/blog">blog</a> where we try to address these and other such issues. Do also visit the <a href="/projects"> projects</a> page where actual, working, open source code goes head to head with societal ossification, moral corruption and the propaganda machine, all at once.</p>
