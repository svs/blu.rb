*blu.rb - a minimal sinatra based blogging engine*

*features*
- write in markdown
- arbitrary layout possible for individual posts
- layouts in haml
- arbitrary 'pages' such as about, contact, etc.

- push to git to publish

*getting started*
# Clone blurb.
# Add a post commit hook in your github repo to hit http://yourblurbserver.com/update_blog
# Put your blog posts in markdown into the views/posts directory. The following rules are applied
## filenames ending in .haml are given the default layout (views/layout.haml)
## filenames with <post_title>.<layout_name>.haml will use the layout in views/layout/_<layout_name>.haml
## all other filenames will be served as html files
