*blu.rb - a minimal sinatra based blogging engine*

blur was started this afternoon, and is incomplete. However, if you still wish to use it for a minimal blogging experience, use it thusly:
- Clone blurb.
- Pull your github blog into the views/posts directory 
- Add a post commit hook in your github repo to hit http://yourblurbserver.com/update_blog
- Write your posts in a text editor of your choice.
- Save them in the posts directory. If you save them with a .erb extension, they will use the site layout. Or else, simply write your own HTML for each page - perfect if you want each post to have its own layout
- Commit to github.
- Repeat last three steps daily for good blog health
